# Transmon-Project

In this repository we have the code used to explore and model several possible circuit designs for a future charge tomography measurement. This code was developed for a MSc research project entitled "Simulating Superconducting Circuit for Charge-Basis Tomography".

## Getting Started

To get started clone the repository and install the required packages by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
from the root of the repository directory.

## Overview

The code is divided between circuit models and analytics, with the vast majority of focus put into circuit models. Circuit models come in four categories:
 - Directly Coupled Circuit
     - Probe-target qubits coupled via a capacitor
     - Longitudinal and transversal coupling is explored
     - Tunability of the qubits is explored
     - Impact of alpha dispersion (variability in probe qubit junctions) is explored
     - Bayesian optimisation of the circuit parameters is implemented
 - Indirectly (Resonator) Coupled Circuit
     - Probe-target qubits coupled via a resonator
     - Longitudinal and transversal coupling is explored
     - Impact of alpha dispersion (variability in probe qubit junctions) is explored
     - Impact of charge state cut-off is inspected
 - Flux Qubit
     - Simple model of a flux qubit
     - Qubit spectrum is plotted for a range of gate charges
 - C-Shunt Circuit
     - Single three junction capacitively shunted qubit
     - Limited time spent on this circuit so far

The circuit model notebooks typically have a system class which describes characterises the quantum system, they then use this class to inspect properties of the circuit in certain parameter regimes.
